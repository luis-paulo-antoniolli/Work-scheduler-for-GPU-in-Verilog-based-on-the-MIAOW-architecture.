# Work-scheduler-for-GPU-in-Verilog-based-on-the-MIAOW-architecture.
A Verilog-based work scheduler module for GPU cores, inspired by the MIAOW architecture. This module is responsible for managing instruction dispatch and workload distribution across compute units, aiming to replicate GCN-like scheduling behavior in hardware.
